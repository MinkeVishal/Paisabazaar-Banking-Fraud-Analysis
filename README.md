# 🔍 Paisabazaar Banking Fraud Analysis

A data-driven project aimed at identifying and analyzing fraudulent banking activities using transaction-level data. This project utilizes **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **machine learning** techniques to detect patterns and anomalies that could indicate **financial fraud** on the Paisabazaar platform.

---

## 📊 Project Objective

The main objectives of this project are:

- To detect potential **fraudulent transactions**.
- To explore **behavioral patterns** associated with fraud.
- To assist in building a **robust fraud detection system**.
- To generate insights that can help reduce **financial risk** and enhance **customer trust**.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Plotly**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Isolation Forest**, **Random Forest**, or **Logistic Regression**
- **SMOTE** (for class imbalance, if needed)

---

## 📂 Dataset

**Source:** [Provide link if available]  
The dataset includes fields such as:

- `Transaction ID`
- `Customer ID`
- `Transaction Amount`
- `Transaction Type`
- `Account Age`
- `Location`
- `Time of Transaction`
- `Is Fraud?` (target label)

---

## 📌 Key Features & Insights

- **Cleaned and preprocessed** raw transactional data.
- Performed **EDA to uncover trends** in fraudulent vs. genuine transactions.
- Visualized **amount distributions**, **frequency by time**, and **fraud patterns by location**.
- Analyzed **correlation heatmaps** and **feature importance** for model interpretability.
- Handled **class imbalance** using SMOTE and undersampling techniques.
- Built and evaluated **fraud detection models** with metrics like precision, recall, F1-score.

---

## 📈 Visualizations

Included visualizations:

- Distribution of transaction amounts by fraud status
- Fraud frequency over time (hourly/daily trends)
- Heatmaps of correlation between numerical features
- Feature importance chart from tree-based models
- Confusion matrix and ROC-AUC curves

---

## 💡 Conclusion

- Fraudulent transactions often involve **unusually high or low amounts**.
- A large number of frauds occur **outside of typical business hours**.
- Certain user behaviors (e.g., sudden account activity) indicate **higher risk**.
- Machine learning models like **Random Forest** and **Isolation Forest** provide strong fraud detection capabilities.

---

## 🚀 Future Work

- Integrate real-time data pipelines for live fraud detection.
- Implement **deep learning approaches** for improved accuracy.
- Deploy model via **API** for use in production systems.
- Incorporate **geospatial** and **device-based features** for enhanced security.
